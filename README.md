# Model Documentation
Examples of the types of model documentation I've created/edited/reviewed

Most of the documentation I've worked on as been confidential and internal, so the two documents I created consistently are listed here as examples. I've listed them below.

## Financial Model Development Document
The model development document is essentially the model's whitepaper: what the model does, how it applies to business needs, and how it works. I've worked on financial models calculating housing rate paths at differing levels of severity. 

## Technical Operating Manual
The technical operating manual is much like the model development document in that it is documentation for a particular model, but the TOM goes more into the tech specs behind the model: what makes it work, how to make it work, and repositories that store important code for the model.
