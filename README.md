# Model Documentation
Examples of the types of model documentation I've created/edited/reviewed

Most has been confidential and internal, so the two documents I created and revised consistently are listed here as examples.
## Financial Model Development Document
The model development document is essentially the model's whitepaper: what the model does, how it applies to business needs, and how it works. I've worked on financial models calculating housing rate paths at differing levels of severity. 

## Technical Operating Manual
The technical operating manual (TOM) is much like the model development document in that it is documentation for a particular model. The TOM goes more into the tech behind the model: what makes it work, how to make it work, and repositories that store important code for the model.
